Acknowledgements:
Thank you for all teachers, your response on ED helps me a lot. Acctually I have no experience on Web Application Development，the assignment is quite difficult for me. 
I spent over 100 hours on it, but luckily finally I completed the assignment. I've learned a lot through this assignment. 
The most interesting thing should be "multiple double ranger sliders". Not only "input range" can be used to make sliders, but also '<div>s' can.  

I would acknowledge to https://www.w3schools.com/ for real-time testing in Separate Controls .
